# CNA440_Final_Project
Advertising is fun! Final project for CNA440 where we attempt to make $1 revenue from ads.

Our website can be found at bunnderfull.cf. 
We are using Google Cloud Platform to host our website. 
bunnderfull.cf was a free domain that Parker obtained from a free domain website.
In GCP, we get $300 of free credits, as of 6/19/2019 ~$16 have been used hosting a bucket for storage and a VM for hosting the website.
Our VM is an ubunutu server running apache.
Our main blocker is that most advertising services have a bunch of hoops to jump through before you're allowed to use their advertisements.
Turns out advertising programs don't like to be on websites that are glorified advertising billboards.
